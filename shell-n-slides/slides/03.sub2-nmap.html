    <p><code>nmap</code> is a network scanning tool that can be used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.</p>
    <p>It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network.</p>
    <p>Let's try a basic scan.</p>
    <p>Run this command in the terminal:</p>
    <code class="clickable-command">sudo nmap --disable-arp-ping -PE -sn <span id="target-net"></span></code>
    <p>This will skip arp and do a ping scan on the network without any port scanning.</p>
