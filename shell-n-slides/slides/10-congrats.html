    <h2>Use the loot!</h2>
    <p>You've successfully hacked the IP camera! ðŸŽ‰</p>
    <p>Let's recap what you've accomplished:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Discovered the camera on the network using nmap</li>
        <li>Found and exploited a vulnerability in the camera's firmware to gain a shell via telnet</li>
        <li>Located sensitive information in the camera's file system (the web interface password)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the password, you can now log directly into the web interface of the camera</p>
