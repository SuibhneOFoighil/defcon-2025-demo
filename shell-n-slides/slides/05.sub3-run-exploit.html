    <h3>Run the Exploit</h3>
    <p>Now that we understand the vulnerability, let's run the exploit:</p>
    <code class="clickable-command">python3 /home/kali/Desktop/tri227wf.py [TARGET_IP] 80</code>
    <p>Replace [TARGET_IP] with the IP address of the camera you discovered earlier.</p>
    <p>If successful, you should see output indicating that the exploit worked.</p>
    <p>Next, we'll use this access to further explore the camera's system.</p>
