    <h2>Log into the web interface</h2>
    <p>Since we have crashed the web server on the camera with out exploit, <br/>in order to log into the camera we need to reset it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the reset camera button in the top right</li>
        <li>Open a new tab in the browser and enter the IP port in the format   <code>http://<span class="target-ip-placeholder">[TARGET IP]</span>:8080</code></li>
        <li>Use the password you found to log in!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is no image as the camera is emulated and has no sensor. Go to the next page to reset this lab for the next user.</p>
