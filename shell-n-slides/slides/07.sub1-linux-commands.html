    <h2>Search the File System</h2>
    <p>Let's search for all text files in the system:</p>
    <code class="clickable-command">ls -lR 2>/dev/null | grep txt</code>
    <p>This command will recursively list all files while ignoring errors and filter for those with 'txt' in the name.</p>
    <p>Take note of any interesting files you find.</p>
