    <h3>IP Address</h3>
    <p>Every device on a network has an Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
    <p>It's like a phone number for the device.</p>
    <p>An IP (version 4) address is a series of numbers separated by periods.</p>
    <p>For example, an IP owned by Google is <code>142.250.68.46</code></p>
    <p>We can find the IP address of this computer by running the command: <code class="clickable-command">ip address</code></p>
