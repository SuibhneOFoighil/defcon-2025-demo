    <h3>Nmap</h3>
    <p>Were you able to see the target?</p>
    <p>There should be a host listed that is not your own IP address</p>
    <p>You can use nmap to enumerate open ports with:</p>
    <code class="clickable-command">sudo nmap -sS <span id="target-ip-address"></span></code>
    <p>This command will perform a SYN scan against the target. What ports are open?</p>
