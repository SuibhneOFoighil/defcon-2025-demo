# Review Diff Command

Perform a comprehensive code review of the current git diff by analyzing all changed files and providing actionable recommendations.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to review your code changes. I'll analyze the git diff, read all modified files, and provide comprehensive code review feedback with specific recommendations.
```

Then immediately proceed with the review process.

## Instructions

### 1. **Create Todo List with All Changes**
   - Run `git diff` to see all current changes in tracked files
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to get list of modified files
   - Run `git status` to understand the current state and find untracked files
   - Run `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to get clean list of untracked files
   - Identify the scope and nature of changes (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
   - Combine both modified and untracked files for complete review scope
   - **Create a TodoWrite with each file as a separate todo item** for systematic review tracking
   - Mark each todo as "pending" initially

### 2. **Get Complete Change Overview**
   - Use the todo list to ensure all files are covered
   - Mark each file todo as "in_progress" when starting its review

### 3. **Read All Changed and New Files in Parallel**
   - Use the combined file list (modified + untracked) to read all files simultaneously
   - For modified files: understand the nature of changes via git diff
   - For untracked files: read entire file content to understand new functionality
   - For each file, understand:
     - The purpose and functionality of the code
     - How the changes fit into the overall architecture
     - Dependencies and relationships with other components
     - Any potential impact on other parts of the system
   - **Mark each file todo as "completed" after finishing its review**

### 4. **Analyze Changes Systematically**
   For each modified and untracked file, evaluate:
   
   **Code Quality:**
   - Code clarity and readability
   - Adherence to project conventions and patterns
   - Proper error handling and edge cases
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations

   **Architecture and Design:**
   - Consistency with existing patterns
   - Separation of concerns
   - Component responsibilities
   - API design and interfaces
   - Data flow and state management

   **Testing and Reliability:**
   - Test coverage for new/modified code
   - Edge case handling
   - Error scenarios and recovery
   - Backward compatibility
   - Integration points

   **Documentation and Maintainability:**
   - Code comments and documentation
   - Variable and function naming
   - Code organization and structure
   - Future maintainability

### 5. **Cross-File Impact Analysis**
   - Identify how changes in one file affect others
   - Check for breaking changes to public APIs
   - Verify consistency across related components
   - Look for potential integration issues
   - Consider deployment and migration impacts

### 6. **Synthesize Findings and Recommendations**
   
   Organize feedback into these categories:

   **üî¥ Critical Issues** (Must fix before merge)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Breaking changes without proper handling
   - Logic errors or bugs
   - Performance regressions

   **üü° Important Improvements** (Should address)
   - Code quality issues
   - Missing error handling
   - Inconsistency with project patterns
   - Missing tests for critical paths

   **üü¢ Suggestions** (Nice to have)
   - Code clarity improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Better naming or organization
   - Additional documentation

   **‚úÖ Positive Feedback**
   - Well-implemented features
   - Good architectural decisions
   - Excellent test coverage
   - Clear and maintainable code

### 7. **Provide Specific, Actionable Recommendations**
   
   For each issue or suggestion:
   - **File and Line Reference**: `path/to/file.ts:123`
   - **Issue Description**: Clear explanation of the problem
   - **Recommendation**: Specific action to take
   - **Code Example**: Show before/after if helpful
   - **Rationale**: Explain why this matters

   **Example Format**:
   ```
   üìç `components/ui/button.tsx:45-52`
   **Issue**: Missing error boundary for async operation
   **Recommendation**: Add try-catch block around the API call
   **Rationale**: Prevents unhandled promise rejections that could crash the component
   ```

### 8. **Generate Review Document**
   
   Create a comprehensive review document in `__agents__/reviews/` with:
   
   **Metadata Collection**:
   - Get current date and time with timezone: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'`
   - Get git commit hash: `git log -1 --format=%H`
   - Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - Get repository name: `basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
   - Create filename: `__agents__/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_code-review.md`

   **Document Structure**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   date: [Current date and time with timezone in ISO format]
   reviewer: Claude
   git_commit: [Current commit hash]
   branch: [Current branch name]
   repository: [Repository name]
   review_type: "Code Review - Git Diff + Untracked Files"
   files_changed: [number]
   files_added: [number of untracked files]
   risk_level: [Low/Medium/High]
   merge_readiness: [Ready/Needs Work/Major Issues]
